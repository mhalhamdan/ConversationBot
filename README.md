# ConversationBot
Discord bot for conversations using Microsoft's large-scale pretrained DialoGPT: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-large

Notes:

Run using your own bot token. Then prompt the bot either by mention or reply and they will respond to you by text generated by the model.
You can switch the model between large, medium, and small by commanding the bot using -model large or -model medium ... etc.
